# Scriptura

This whitepaper proposes **Scriptura**: an open source code editor that reproduces the parts of the Cursor experience people actually pay for, on top of open tooling, with the model layer treated as a swappable backend rather than a captive one. A user installs Scriptura, points it at whichever model provider they already trust (a local Ollama instance, an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, an in-house proxy), and gets the editing, chat, agent, and completion experience without surrendering their code or their choice of model.

The closest sibling inside the collective is Nanocoder, which is the agent runtime. Scriptura is the *editor* that wraps that runtime. Nanocoder is the engine; Scriptura is the cabin. The two are designed to compose, and the design below assumes Nanocoder as the default local backend while keeping the provider abstraction open enough that anything satisfying the contract can sit behind it.

The document is published in working form so the collective can argue the shape of it before code lands. Naming, scope, and design decisions below are open and should be settled during the public review window (recorded under "Resolved in review" at the bottom of this page).

The proposed editor base already exists at [https://github.com/jason1015-coder/scriptura](https://github.com/jason1015-coder/scriptura)

## Problem

A developer who wants an AI-shaped editing experience today picks from a small set of options, none of which fully satisfy the privacy- and locality-first posture the collective cares about:

1. **Proprietary AI editors (Cursor, Windsurf, and others).** Excellent UX, tightly integrated agent and completion loops, codebase indexing out of the box. Closed source on the editor side and on the model-routing side. Your code and your prompts go to the vendor's servers unless you pay for the privacy tier, and even then the routing and retention behaviour is a promise in a privacy policy, not something you can audit. The model you use is the model the vendor chose to wire in; bringing your own is second-class.
2. **VS Code plus a copilot-style extension.** Open editor, closed (or limited) AI backend. Copilot binds you to one vendor. Open alternatives exist but each re-implements the same thin chat panel and none deliver the *editing* feel Cursor nailed: the inline completion that predicts edits, the multi-file agent that actually applies changes, the `@codebase` context that reads the right files without you listing them.
3. **Terminal agents (Nanocoder, Aider, Claude Code).** Powerful, local-first, model-agnostic. But they live in the terminal. They do not give you the inline-edit affordance, the diff preview in place, the hover-to-explain, the tab-to-accept completion. They are a different category of tool that solves a different part of the problem.
4. **Rolling your own editor.** Theoretically possible on the VS Code fork or on a from-scratch web view. The integration work to get completion latency under control, to index a codebase well enough for `@codebase`, and to make the agent loop feel safe is large and largely unglamorous. Most developers who start this abandon it before the feels right.

None of these gives a developer an editor that (a) feels like Cursor, (b) is open source end to end, (c) lets them bring any model they want, local or remote, and (d) keeps their code on hardware they control by default. The gap is not a missing feature; it is a missing *posture*. Cursor proved the experience is worth building. The posture is what no one has shipped openly.

## Intended audience

Scriptura is built for developers who want the Cursor experience without the Cursor captivity. The audience is broad, but the project optimises hardest for a specific shape of user:

- **Local-first developers.** People who already run Ollama, LM Studio, or llama.cpp and want their editor's completions and agents to run against those models. This is the loudest case for the project and the natural first design partner.
- **Privacy-sensitive teams.** Organisations that cannot send source to a third party, who need the editor to prove (not promise) that the code stays local unless they explicitly route it elsewhere.
- **Model-flexible developers.** People who want to swap providers per task: a small local model for completions, a large remote model for the hard agent pass, a self-hosted proxy for audit logging. The provider abstraction is for them.
- **VS Code refugees.** Developers who like the VS Code editing model but not the telemetry, the vendor lock, or the copilot billing, and who want an open editor that inherits the extension ecosystem rather than forking it badly.

What the project is explicitly **not** optimised for, at least in v1:

- **Non-technical users.** Scriptura is a code editor. It assumes you can read a diff and configure a model endpoint.
- **Enterprises needing SSO, centralized policy, and audit export.** That is a phase 2 surface, and a plausible one if the local-first installs land first.
- **People who want zero configuration.** Local-first means at least one model endpoint has to exist somewhere. The project makes that cheap, not invisible.

The work that remains is choosing where to point the documentation and the defaults on day one, not narrowing the product itself. A v1 that documents "here is the editor, here is the provider abstraction, here is how to point it at a local model, here is how to point it at a remote one" is honest to what the product actually is.

## Principles

The three values that govern every Nano Collective project apply:

- **Privacy respecting.** The editor reads source code, which is sensitive. The default deployment is honest about exactly which bytes go where. With a local provider, nothing leaves the machine; the editor can prove this because the provider call is a localhost request the user can observe. With a remote provider, that path is explicit configuration, never hidden behaviour, and the editor surfaces clearly which requests it is about to send and to where. There is no background sync, no telemetry-by-default, no "privacy mode" that is a paid tier rather than the baseline.
- **Local first.** The completion and agent loops must make local providers (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, MLX, or Nanocoder on a local model) a first-class path with latency that feels native. Remote is allowed where capability requires it and is opt-in rather than the default.
- **Open for all.** Full source open. The provider abstraction documented in enough detail that anyone can write an adapter for a model backend we never anticipated. Anyone can run Scriptura without an account, a key we issued, or a service we host.


## Architecture

The current implementation consists of full C++ QT based editor shell, with no AI layer yet.

The proposed solution will be adding a widget to the editor shell that provides AI functionality, by integrating with existing nanocoder agent (which is in typescript)


### Why this shape is the point

A proprietary editor could do steps 2-4 with a better model. What it cannot do is step 5 by default, or let the developer swap the model in steps 2-4 for one they own. The combination of "Cursor feel" plus "local by default" plus "any model behind a real contract" is the part no one has shipped openly. The context engine and the agent loop are the hard parts; the provider abstraction is what makes the whole thing mean something.

## Composition with other collective projects

Most collective projects compose with Scriptura through the provider contract. A few have a more specific shape worth naming:

- **[Nanocoder](https://github.com/Nano-Collective/nanocoder)** is the reference agent backend. Scriptura's agent loop is a thin UI over Nanocoder's non-interactive mode; the same prompts, the same tool access, the same local-first posture. Scriptura pressure-tests Nanocoder on a real interactive workload, the way Sentinel pressure-tests it on a security workload.
- **[Private Inference Proxy](/collective/whitepapers/private-inference-proxy)**, if it lands, is a natural remote provider adapter. A user who needs cloud capability for the hard agent pass but wants audit logging and scrubbing routes Scriptura's remote calls through the proxy rather than directly at a vendor. The provider abstraction is exactly the seam this plugs into.
- **[Sentinel](/collective/whitepapers/sentinel)** composes the other way: Scriptura could invoke a Sentinel audit pass against the current workspace as a command, surfacing findings as in-editor diagnostics rather than GitHub issues.

This is the long picture from the collective's introduction page expressed as an editor on the same stack: local-first models, a real provider contract anyone can extend, and privacy-preserving paths to external capability when the task genuinely requires it. Scriptura is the editing-shaped instance of the same pattern Nanocoder demonstrates for agents and Sentinel demonstrates for audits.

## v1 scope

A deliberately narrow v1, shipped well.

- **An editor built on the open VS Code sources**, with the proprietary AI surfaces removed and Scriptura's AI layer in their place. No account required to launch.
- **The provider abstraction with at least two adapters shipped:** a local Ollama/LM Studio adapter and an OpenAI-compatible adapter. Nanocoder wired in as the agent backend.
- **The inline completion loop** against the local provider, with tab-to-accept and latency treated as a primary metric.
- **The chat and inline-edit surfaces** with `@codebase` retrieval through the local context engine.
- **The agent loop** over Nanocoder, proposing diffs the user accepts in place, with command execution scoped to pre-approved commands.
- **The egress log**, local and readable, marking every request as local or remote with its destination.
- **Documentation for writing an adapter**, so the model-agnostic contract is real and extensible, not aspirational.

What v1 ships is "an open editor with the Cursor feel, a real provider contract, and a local-first default that holds." Not a hosted service. Not a model. Not an enterprise control plane.

## What it is not (in v1)

- **Not a Copilot replacement that phones home.** The default install makes no remote calls. Remote providers are opt-in configuration, never hidden behaviour.
- **Not a model trainer or a model vendor.** Scriptura uses whichever providers the user points it at. The collective does not train or ship an editor-tuned model of its own in v1.
- **Not a from-scratch editor.** It is built on the existing base . A clean-room reimplementation would forfeit that inheritance for no gain.
- **Not a guaranteed-latency product on weak hardware.** Local-first means the feel depends on the local model. On a machine too small to run a completion model, the experience degrades; the project documents the floor rather than hiding it.
- **Not a replacement for terminal agents.** Nanocoder in the terminal still wins for some workflows. Scriptura is the in-editor surface, not the only surface.

## Alternatives considered

- **Fork Cursor directly.** Impossible: Cursor is closed source. Its value is in the proprietary layer we are precisely trying to replace. No fork path exists.
- **Ship only as a VS Code extension, not a fork.** Already exists, but has less potential for expansion, integration, and customization.
- **Fork VS Code.** Possible, but more performance overhead, which is not good for a machine already running a local LLM.


## Resolved in review

(none yet)

## Open questions

1. **Naming.** Is **Scriptura** the name, or does it collide with something, or read wrong? The working title is a Latin noun (writing / scripture), fitting the collective's noun convention. Open until settled.
2. **Default provider out of the box.** If the user has no local model running, does v1 ship with a clear "install Ollama, here is the one-liner" flow, or fall back to a configured remote endpoint with a loud warning? The local-first principle says the former; activation cost says the latter. Unresolved.
3. **Extension host policy.** Does Scriptura keep the full VS Code extension host (inheriting the ecosystem but also its Copilot assumptions), or ship a restricted host that blocks extensions touching the removed surfaces? Full host is more compatible, less safe. Unresolved.

## Next steps

For this whitepaper to graduate into docs:

- [ ] Resolve the naming question.
- [ ] Write the provider contract in enough detail that "model-agnostic" is a testable claim, not a slogan.
- [ ] Decide the out-of-the-box provider flow for a user with no local model.
- [ ] Decide the extension host policy (full vs. restricted).


When those are settled, this document becomes the foundation of the project's README and design notes. A repository is created under [`Nano-Collective`](https://github.com/Nano-Collective), and the [Creating a New Project](/collective/projects/creating-a-new-project) playbook takes over.

This page stays in place after the project ships, as the historical record of how the design was argued.
