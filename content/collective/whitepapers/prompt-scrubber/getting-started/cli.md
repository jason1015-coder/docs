# CLI Reference

The `prompt-scrub` package provides a command-line interface for manual inspection, scripting, and pipeline integration. 

## Core Commands

### `prompt-scrub scrub [file]`
Reads a message from `stdin` or a file and prints the scrubbed message to `stdout`. The session ID is printed to `stderr`.

**Options:**
- `--session-id <id>`: Reuse an existing session map. If omitted, a new UUID is generated.
- `--disable <detectors>`: Comma-separated list of detectors to disable (e.g. `EmailDetector,PhoneDetector`).

### `prompt-scrub rehydrate [file]`
Reads a scrubbed response from `stdin` or a file and prints the rehydrated response to `stdout`.

**Warnings (stderr):**
If the model hallucinates a placeholder that does not exist in the session map (e.g., the model outputs `Secret_2` but only `Secret_1` was scrubbed), the tool passes the string through unchanged to `stdout`, but emits a warning directly to `stderr`.

**Options:**
- `--session-id <id>` (Required): The session ID used during the `scrub` phase to restore original values.

### `prompt-scrub inspect [file]`
Reads a message from `stdin` or a file and prints a human-readable diff of the transformations the scrubber will apply.

**Options:**
- `--disable <detectors>`: Comma-separated list of detectors to disable.

## Session Management

### `prompt-scrub sessions list`
Lists all known session IDs currently stored on disk along with their file sizes.

### `prompt-scrub sessions show <id>`
Prints the raw JSON contents of a session map for inspection or manual editing.

### `prompt-scrub sessions rm <id>`
Deletes a session map from the disk permanently.

## Utility

### `prompt-scrub --version`
Prints the current version of the CLI.

### `prompt-scrub --help`
Prints standard help documentation and available commands.
